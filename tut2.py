####String Slicing
mystr = "Mohammed Sameer"
# print(mystr[0:9])  ##here 0 will be included but  n '9' will be excluded meaning only till 8 it gets printed.
# print(mystr[9])

print(len(mystr))
#print(mystr[0:50])



###string skip slicing
#print(mystr[0:9:2])     ### first 0 is starting of str , 9 till where the substring should be , and 2 means it skips 1 after the other str and print the remaining. 
#print(mystr[0::2])        ### include the whole string and skips one after the another str and print the rest.


###Negative indexing
# print(mystr[-4:-2])
# print(mystr[::-1])   ###used to reverse the string
